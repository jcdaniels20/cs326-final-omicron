Section 2: Innovative Idea
For this project, our team wanted to create a web application that deals with wildlife conservation in the state of Massachusetts and possibly the United States. 
Specifically, this web application would act as an interactive database for endangered/at-risk wildlife across the state(s). Users would be able to access information on species such as native habitats as well as migratory patterns. Users would also be able to create a personal log-in account to load and share information onto the website such as pictures they’ve taken of endangered wildlife, their specimen’s information (gender, approximate weight/height, time of year, etc.) and their sighted location. On top of this, our application would also hope to provide a number of secondary functions: educate people on species in their backyard, how to get involved in local conservation efforts, and general practices for becoming more eco-friendly.
At the current moment, the Mass gov website offers a database for endangered species in Massachusetts as well as information on each species. While this is a similar application, ours looks to focus more on user interaction rather than just simply being a database itself. With this web application, we want to inspire users to actively report endangered wildlife and be able to see what other users have reported as well. We also wish for this to be an application where people can see local conservation efforts and get involved in helping to protect the environment and make better environmentally conscious decisions.
Section 3: Important Components
For the first function, we want to have an active database for endangered/at-risk species that houses information on the species and allows users to view said information. If they have an account, they can input data into the database (making sure that they can only edit and delete their inputs). We also want to have an image gallery where users can upload their own taken photos of the specific species. Next, we will implement a function where users can see local wildlife organizations/centers that are close to their location. Finally, we wish to implement a tab for educational purposes. This would include informational blips about good practices for being environmentally friendly as well as possible videos and current articles on nature that are circulating through the news. This covers the main features that we wish to implement for our web applications.

Users are capable of completing/performing:
~Logging new sighting of the endangered species.
~Create an Instagram/Poshmark-like post - where users can react and like each other posts. Users can also comment on each other posts
~It will pull geolocation data, and a database of sightings - profiles of species (species profile info contains things such as gender or approximate size)
~Users will input data about species when entering, such as gender, color, time of day.
~Users can edit own sighting data and their own posts but not other users
~All posts are viewable to everyone like Poshmark
